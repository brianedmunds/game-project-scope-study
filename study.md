## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
-   The data structure you plan to use.

I am still planning this out.  What I know so far is that I I will use divs in HTML for each of the 9 cells on the board.  From there, I will likely use JavaScript and click events to drive the placemenet of X's and O's, switch players, and track game completion.  I'll likely also need to make use of arrays.

I am not certain what is meant by this.  I will follow up on this in class and then add these details.

-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS

I will be stragetic in my use of classes and IDs so that my page elements are easily acccessible using JS.

-   How you plan to approach this project.

    I plan to approach this project methodically.  First, I'll create wireframes and user stories.  From there, I'll begin to build out the HTML and CSS to structure and style the app.  Ill then use JavaScript to interact with the app, and use AJAX to connect to the back end

-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
1.) As a user, I will be able to create an account so that I can log in and track my history of games played, wins, and losses.
2.) As a user, I will have the ability to change my password, so that I can still access my account if I forget my password.
3.) As a user, I will be able to play this game on any mainstream desktop browser.
4.) As a user, I want to be able to start a new game from within the browser without having to refresh the page.
5.) As a developer, I want the README to be adequately documented so that it will be easy for me to understand the technologies and methodologies used to create this app.
6.) As a user, I want the game to switch between players seemlessly so that I can play agaist another opponent in real time.
7.) As a user, I want there to be a visual indicator of which side won so that wins/losses are easily identifiable.



-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
Following the approach that has been conveyed to the class over the past few days, I will structure my files in such a way so that their duties are separately.  For example, I will create a script folder within an assets folder, and that scripts folder will have an app.js file, index.js file, and ui.js file to separate out that functionality and export from each file as needed.  I'll also have a file to house CSS separately from the HTML.

-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
I am still thinking about ways that I can add a creative spin to the project.  I'm considering using an image of a grid as my tic tac toe board, rather than outlining the boxes of my divs.  I'll also experiment with colors, and perhaps using icons as my 'x' and 'o' instead of the letters.  These decisions are still TBD.

-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?

I will commit early and often, and will use descriptive commit messages so taht it can be easily understood what each commit involved.

-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?

I woudl look to attempt at least of the bonuses, but will not commit to that at this point.  I will focus on delivering the required specificatinos first, and then consider the bonuses if sufficient time remains.

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.
